# Wow | Jun 28th 2024
so this is something I've been putting making this off for about 4 months now. I finally sat down and did most of the site today so I could stop stressing myself out over it. I'm not exactly sure if this is how i want the layout to stay, i like the black on white but i might switch to a blue grey color scheme later. Anywho hello, i'm kiri, I like dwarves so i made this dwarven themed cause they don't get nearly enough appreciation. This mostly exists for bookbug, an online bookclub i'm joining, maybe some rants and/or picture galleries later if i get around to it. But honestly i'm quite slow at doing anything and slower at actually understanding what i'm doing. So don't hold out hope my adoring fans.


# Travel! | Jun 29th 2024
I am flying in a few hours, the trip to my destination will be one day and five hours total. Death be upon me, I have moved around a lot, and this isn't the first time i've had a flight this long but... It aint fun. It really aint. Anyways I'll get to see my cousins, my classes will finally not be at 3 am due to the timezone change and best of all i get to see the cutest little dog in the world ever. I might post a picture of him later, he's such a cutie.

This felt like more of a status update than a blog, I'll try to add things with more substance and some sort of knowledge gain backing them in the future, but uh yeah travelling has me going crazy.
