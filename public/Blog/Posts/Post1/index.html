<p>so this is something I've been putting making this off for about 4 months now. I finally sat down and did most of the site today so I could stop stressing myself out over it. I'm not exactly sure if this is how i want the layout to stay, i like the black on white but i might switch to a blue grey color scheme later. Anywho hello, i'm kiri, I like dwarves so i made this dwarven themed cause they don't get nearly enough appreciation. This mostly exists for bookbug, an online bookclub i'm joining, maybe some rants and/or picture galleries later if i get around to it. But honestly i'm quite slow at doing anything and slower at actually understanding what i'm doing. So don't hold out hope my adoring fans.</p>
