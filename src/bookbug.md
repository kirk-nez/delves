**•<u>To the Lighthouse|July</u>**

Haven't read it before, hadn't heard of it before, but i hope it's a good read

DNF
Unfortunately it was a bit dense to read, so I didn't end up finishing it. It was a busy summer in general so one thing led to another, or in this case didn't, and i never got around to it.

**•<u>Pnin|August</u>**

This book i'm looking forward to, I heard its a comedy, and read the first few pages. It reads like my grandpa telling a long winded story, which is surprisingly not a turn-off for Pnin. I think i'll finish it, no promises though.

Post-Read
Hi i'm back, and its late
So i had to get my computer repaired, and then they didn't repair, so i just got my computer back yesterday.
ANYWAYS BOOK
it kept the feeling of my grandpa the entire way through, honestly very charming. It was a good read, the ending was depressing but thats kinda just life. Pnin deserved better. I will return later to actually write this. i've got essays due
