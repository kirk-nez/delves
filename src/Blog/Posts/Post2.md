I am flying in a few hours, the trip to my destination will be one day and five hours total. Death be upon me, I have moved around a lot, and this isn't the first time i've had a flight this long but... It aint fun. It really aint. Anyways I'll get to see my cousins, my classes will finally not be at 3 am due to the timezone change and best of all i get to see the cutest little dog in the world ever. I might post a picture of him later, he's such a cutie.

This felt like more of a status update than a blog, I'll try to add things with more substance and some sort of knowledge gain backing them in the future, but uh yeah travelling has me going crazy.
