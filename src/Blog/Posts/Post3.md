So I have put a stupid amount of time into thinking about and researching how to learn languages. I'd probably learn better if i spent that time studying the languages themselves but thats beside the point.

This stuff has all just been floating in my head for a few years so i guess here's a good place to plop down my collective thoughts on the topic. Some of it is academically researched, other parts are ancedotes, and some of its just things that seem smart to me. Anyways thats to say this isn't super professional or sciencey, its just a collection of personal knowledge.

First, a rating system of fluency. I'll be using CEFR (common european frame of refernce for languages. i don't know where the L went in the acronym)
|CEFR Levels               |  | 
|--------------------------|--|
|A1-A2 (beginner)     |you know jack shit|
|B1-B2 (intermediate) |you know some shit|
| C1-C2 (advanced)    |you know your shit|
